# Roll a Ball

This repository contains the completed code that was created from the 'Roll a Ball' demo for Unity 3D.

The link to the demo video is [here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial)

## Introduction

The video provides a step by step introduction into the world of Unity 3D, where we build a small game that demonstrates how to navigate around the development environment along with attaching scripts to a 3D object that we can control.

Comments have been placed within the scripts to get a better understanding of the flow between the graphical objects (Game Objects) and the controllers (Scripts).

Code has been provided in C# and built with the MonoDevelop Editor that comes with Unity.
